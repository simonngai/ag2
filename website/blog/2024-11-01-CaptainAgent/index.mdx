![Illustration of how Captain Agent build a team](img/overall.png)

**TL;DR**
- We introduce Captain Agent, an agent equipped with the capability to adaptively assemble a team of agents through retrieval-selection-generation process to handle complex tasks via nested chat.
- Captain Agent supports all types of `ConversableAgents` implemented in Autogen.


# Introduction

In this blog, we introduce **Captain Agent**, an agent that can automatically build a team of agents to fulfill diverse, complex task requirements.
We design a two-step workflow for Captain Agent to build a high quality team and solve the problem:
- (**Step 1**) Captain Agent will first identify a subtask instructed by our prompt, list several roles needed for this subtask, and then create a team of agents accordingly by retrieval, selection, and generation. Each of these will be equipped with predefined tools retrieved from the tool library.
![Building workflow](img/build.png)
- (**Step 2**) this team of agents will attempt to solve the subtask via conversation with the free-form tool using. Once it's done, a reflector LLM will provide Captain Agent with a reflection report for it to decide whether to adjust the team or subtask instruction or to terminate and output the results.

We provide an agent library and a tool library for Captain Agent to choose from when building the team. In the following section, we demonstrate how to use the libraries.

# Using Agent Library
To use captain agent, we need to instantiate a CaptainAgent and the corresponding CaptainUserProxy, then initiate a chat. To  we just need to add a line of configuration to the settings.

```python
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.captain_agent import CaptainAgent
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.captain_user_proxy_agent import CaptainUserProxyAgent

general_llm_config = {
    "temperature": 0,
    "config_list": autogen.config_list_from_json("OAI_CONFIG_LIST", filter_dict={"model": ["gpt-4-1106-preview"]}),
}

nested_mode_config = {
    "autobuild_init_config": {
        "config_file_or_env": "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
        "builder_model": "gpt-4-1106-preview",
        "agent_model": "gpt-4-1106-preview",
    },
    # this is used to configure the autobuild building process
    "autobuild_build_config": {
        "default_llm_config": {"temperature": 1, "top_p": 0.95, "max_tokens": 1500, "seed": 52},
        # this is used to configure the user proxy within nested chat
        "code_execution_config": {"timeout": 300, "work_dir": "groupchat", "last_n_messages": 1},
        "coding": True,
        # modify this line to change the agent library path
        "library_path_or_json": "notebook/captainagent_expert_library.json",
    },
    "group_chat_config": {"max_round": 15},
    "group_chat_llm_config": general_llm_config.copy(),
}

## build agents
captain_agent = CaptainAgent(name="captain_agent", llm_config=general_llm_config, nested_mode="autobuild")
captain_user_proxy = CaptainUserProxyAgent(
    name="captain_user_proxy",
    nested_mode_config=nested_mode_config,
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False},
    agent_config_save_path=None,  # If you'd like to save the created agents in nested chat for further use, specify the path here
)

query = 'Find the stock price of Microsoft in the past 1 year and plot a line chart to show the trend. Save the line chart as "microsoft_stock_price.png".'

result = captain_user_proxy.initiate_chat(captain_agent, message=query, max_turns=3)
```

# Using Agent Library and Tool Library
We provide a built-in tool library. To fully use the tools in it, refer to the instructions in the [docs](/docs/topics/captainagent/tool). Running the following instructions requires

```python
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.captain_agent import CaptainAgent
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.captain_user_proxy_agent import CaptainUserProxyAgent

nested_mode_config = {
    "autobuild_init_config": {
        "config_file_or_env": "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
        "builder_model": "gpt-4-1106-preview",
        "agent_model": "gpt-4-1106-preview",
    },
    # this is used to configure the autobuild building process
    "autobuild_build_config": {
        "default_llm_config": {"temperature": 1, "top_p": 0.95, "max_tokens": 1500, "seed": 52},
        # this is used to configure the user proxy within nested chat
        "code_execution_config": {"timeout": 300, "work_dir": "groupchat", "last_n_messages": 1},
        "coding": True,
        "library_path_or_json": "notebook/captainagent_expert_library.json",
    },
    # this is used to configure the tool library
    "autobuild_tool_config": {
        "tool_root": "default",  # this will use the tool library we provide
        "retriever": "all-mpnet-base-v2",
    },
    # this is used to configure the group chat
    "group_chat_config": {"max_round": 15},
    "group_chat_llm_config": general_llm_config.copy(),
}

# The function requires BING api key and Rapid API key to work. You can follow the instructions from docs to get one.
import os

os.environ["BING_API_key"] = "" # set your bing api key here, if you do not need search engine, you can skip this step
os.environ["RAPID_API_KEY"] = "" # set your rapid api key here, in order for this example to work, you need to subscribe to the youtube transcription api (https://rapidapi.com/solid-api-solid-api-default/api/youtube-transcript3)

## build agents
captain_agent = CaptainAgent(name="captain_agent", llm_config=general_llm_config, nested_mode="autobuild")
captain_user_proxy = CaptainUserProxyAgent(
    name="captain_user_proxy",
    nested_mode_config=nested_mode_config,
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False},
    agent_config_save_path=None,  # If you'd like to save the created agents in nested chat for further use, specify the path here
)

query = """# Task
Your task is to solve a question given by a user.

# Question
Examine the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec.

What does Teal'c say in response to the question "Isn't that hot?"
""".strip()
result = captain_user_proxy.initiate_chat(captain_agent, message=query)
```
